# Image Captioning with Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a system capable of generating descriptive captions for images while also analyzing the sentiment conveyed within the image. Leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence generation, this system provides meaningful captions while considering the emotional context of the visual content.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   https://github.com/vivekcodz222/Image_captioning_with_sentiment_analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download pre-trained models and datasets (if necessary).

## Usage

### Training

To train the image captioning model with sentiment analysis, execute the following command:

```
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --save_model /path/to/save/model
```

### Inference

To generate captions and analyze sentiment for a specific image, use the following command:

```
python infer.py --image_path /path/to/image --model_path /path/to/saved/model
```

## Data Preparation

### Dataset

The dataset used for training consists of images paired with corresponding captions and sentiment labels. This dataset can be sourced from various publicly available image-caption datasets such as MSCOCO, Flickr30k, etc., augmented with sentiment annotations or derived from sentiment-labeled image datasets.

### Pre-processing

Pre-processing involves resizing images to a uniform size, tokenizing captions, and encoding sentiment labels. Additionally, text data is pre-processed by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization.

## Model Architecture

The image captioning model with sentiment analysis comprises two main components:

1. **Image Encoder**: A pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG) extracts high-level features from input images.

2. **Caption Generator with Sentiment Analysis**: An RNN (e.g., LSTM, GRU) generates captions conditioned on both image features and sentiment embeddings.

## Results

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as BLEU score for caption generation quality and accuracy for sentiment analysis. Qualitative assessment involves visual inspection of generated captions and sentiment predictions.

## Future Work

Potential avenues for improvement and expansion of this project include:

- Fine-tuning pre-trained models for better feature extraction.
- Incorporating attention mechanisms to focus on relevant image regions.
- Experimenting with different sentiment analysis techniques for enhanced emotional understanding.
- Deployment of the model as a web service or integration into existing applications.
